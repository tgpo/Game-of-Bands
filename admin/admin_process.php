By popular upvote count this round's theme is **[" . $ourtheme[0] .

Team members are **strongly encouraged** to comment in their team thread below *as soon as possible*.  If any team has difficulty assembling, there will be a new team consolidation post shortly after, and teams missing members as well as any registrants who could not be placed or registered late are free to self-organize into new teams.  Non-team submissions are welcome and encouraged, but are not eligible for the official contest win , though maybe for other prizes or w/e;.

Teams are assigned at random by what Juniper Ale left intact.

Voting rules will be announced in the voting thread.\n\nMeet your teammates and get going!  Good luck to everyone and thanks for participating.
